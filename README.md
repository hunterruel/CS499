**Professional Self Assessment**<br/>

Southern New Hampshire University's Computer Science program has impacted my life in the most positive way for my future career and personal goals. The professors, staff, and student peers have all been exceptionally helpful in my learning experience and personal development as a student in the Computer Science field. I have had a passion for computers, how they operate, and the science involving software and hardware since I was a child. Now looking back at all I have learned on this journey; it was well worth the time and sacrifice of completing this Computer Science degree. This Senior Capstone course has taught me how to be self suffient in my coding abilities and gave me confidence in creating my own enhancements. Not only have I learned greatly about the computer sciences, but I have also made many friends and acquaintances along the way while developing higher social skills through group discussions and collaboration.<br/><br/>

**Enhanced Artifact - Category One: Software Design and Engineering**<br/>

**Narrative**<br/>

This artifact is a 3D representation created to look as close as possible to the image we chose to display in CS330. The scene resembles a picture of a square wood surface holding a piece of white paper, maroon MP3 player, and black iPhone box on top of it. On the bottom layer is gray carpet that holds the square piece of wood. Each texture was specially chosen to portray what each object in the 3D scene looked like. This scene was originally created in term 21EW6. I chose this project for Category One: Software Design and Engineering because I saw potential in enhancing this artifact to be even better and more efficient. I also believe that using this artifact can showcase what I have learned in the course with coding and the program features. For example, the main goal of this software and engineering enhancement was to create four additional objects in the 3D scene that used my coding knowledgeability and creativeness. As you can see in the project, each object was added with specific location, size, and texture requirements to fit my planned enhancement goals. Each object resembled a leg of the wooden table. As I was enhancing the project to meet my goals, the hardest challenge I faced was continuously modifying the location and size of the four different objects to appear as if it was meant to be part of the original scene. Once I had the correct size of each object, the location and placement of each object fit into the 3D scene effectively to represent a table figure. The learning process throughout this enhancement was fulfilling and a lot of trial and error to get the objects and placement correct.<br/><br/>

**Enhanced Artifact - Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**<br/>

**Narrative**<br/>

This artifact is a simple calculator that was originally created to do mathematic equations using algorithms specified in the code of the program. The calculator uses Eclipse IDE for Java Developers to run the application (using Java). This application was originally created in term 21EW5. During the project, we were able to create a few different algorithms for simple mathematical equations such as addition, subtraction, division, and equal/clear buttons displayed on the interface of the calculator. Given that expertise in algorithms and data structures are essential for computer science professionals in the learning and career fields, I chose this artifact to demonstrate my proficiency in that area as well as Java coding. The artifact was improved by eliminating any comments or code that was unnecessary and leaving any code or comments that can be useful for the future. This artifact was enhanced by the addition of including another calculator function button of multiplication. The other enhancement I was attempting to complete was a random number generator algorithm. I met the goal of accomplishing the multiplication button on the calculator, although the random number generator I was not able to complete. Throughout the process of learning how to create the random number generator (RNG), I was given the challenge to come up with a method to take one number and use the random number generator button to create another random number. I learned that no number is necessarily random, and there is an algorithm behind the predictability of the number given. Therefore, I will be continuing the RNG enhancement in the future after more research is completed. The multiplication enhancement went well without many challenges other than relearning how to code in Java after some time away from using the coding language frequently.<br/><br/>

**Narrative**<br/>

This artifact consists of data that was developed from 500 customers in Bubba Gump sales. The customer data that was gathered from each customer consists of customer age, gender, city, state, zip code, and income. This sample data set from Bubba Gump sales is from course DAT220 Fundamentals of Data Mining (21EW3). I selected this item for Category Three: Databases because it encapsulates the concepts of databases and showcases my skills in data mining. The goal of enhancing this artifact is to data mine the statistics of Bubba Gump to find superior data that is more effective and significant for the company to increase their sales and pinpoint which customers they will be able to target in the future. During the analysis of data mining Bubba Gump's customer information, I met the objectives of the enhancement by finding out key information on the customers of which to target in the future for Bubba Gump's maximum marketing ability. While learning how to data mine more effienctly, I ran into a few challenges such as knowing what key factors to look for in the data set. Throughout finding key factors, I learned to sort the data based on the customer's age, how much was spent on purchases, and what the customers income was to decide what would be the most critical information to the company.
