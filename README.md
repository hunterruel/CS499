**Professional Self Assessment**<br/>

Southern New Hampshire University's Computer Science program has impacted my life in the most positive way for my future career and personal goals. The professors, staff, and student peers have all been exceptionally helpful in my learning experience and personal development as a student in the Computer Science field. I have had a passion for computers, how they operate, and the science involving software and hardware since I was a child. Now looking back at all I have learned on this journey; it was well worth the time and sacrifice of completing this Computer Science degree. Not only have I learned greatly about the computer sciences, but I have also made many friends and acquaintances along the way while developing higher social skills through group discussions and collaboration.<br/><br/>

**Narrative**<br/>

This artifact is a 3D representation created to look as close as possible to the image we chose to display in CS330. The scene resembles a picture of a square wood surface holding a piece of white paper, maroon MP3 player, and black iPhone box on top of it. On the bottom layer is gray carpet that holds the square piece of wood. Each texture was specially chosen to portray what each object in the 3D scene looked like. This scene was originally created in term 21EW6. I chose this project for Category One: Software Design and Engineering because I saw potential in enhancing this artifact to be even better and more efficient. I also believe that using this artifact can showcase what I have learned in the course with coding and the program features. For example, the main goal of this software and engineering enhancement was to create four additional objects in the 3D scene that used my coding knowledgeability and creativeness. As you can see in the project, each object was added with specific location, size, and texture requirements to fit my planned enhancement goals. Each object resembled a leg of the wooden table. As I was enhancing the project to meet my goals, the hardest challenge I faced was continuously modifying the location and size of the four different objects to appear as if it was meant to be part of the original scene. Once I had the correct size of each object, the location and placement of each object fit into the 3D scene effectively to represent a table figure. The learning process throughout this enhancement was fulfilling and a lot of trial and error to get the objects and placement correct.<br/>
